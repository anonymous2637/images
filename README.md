**1. What is overfitting, and how can it be prevented?**  
**Answer:**  
Overfitting is when a model learns not just the patterns but also the noise in training data. It performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data because it's memorizing rather than generalizing.

**Ways to prevent overfitting:**
- **Cross-Validation:** Use k-fold cross-validation to test performance across different data splits.
- **Regularization:**  
  - **L1 (Lasso)**: Encourages sparsity (zeros out less important features).  
  - **L2 (Ridge)**: Shrinks large weights and distributes learning evenly.
- **Simpler Models:** Reduce the number of layers/trees/nodes to avoid complexity.
- **Early Stopping:** Stop training when performance on the validation set starts degrading.
- **Dropout:** In neural nets, randomly ignore some neurons during training.
- **Data Augmentation / More Data:** Helps the model generalize better by seeing varied examples.

---

**2. Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization. When would you use each?**  
**Answer:**  
Both are ways to penalize model complexity and reduce overfitting.

- **L1 (Lasso):** Adds the absolute value of coefficients to the loss function. It can shrink some weights to exactly **zero**, which helps in **feature selection**.
- **L2 (Ridge):** Adds the square of coefficients. Shrinks all weights but doesn’t eliminate them. Good when you want **all features** to contribute a little.

**Use L1** when you suspect some features are noise.  
**Use L2** when you think all features are important but want to prevent overfitting.

---

**3. How do you handle imbalanced datasets?**  
**Answer:**  
When one class significantly outweighs the others, accuracy can lie.

**Strategies:**
- **Resampling:**
  - **Oversample** the minority class (e.g., SMOTE).
  - **Undersample** the majority class.
- **Class Weighting:** Assign higher weights to the minority class during training.
- **Specialized Metrics:** Use precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC instead of accuracy.
- **Ensemble Models:** Boosting or bagging models can learn minority class patterns better.
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Use techniques like SMOTE or GANs.

---

**4. What is the difference between Type I and Type II errors?**  
**Answer:**  
These relate to false positives and false negatives in classification:

- **Type I Error (False Positive):** Predicting something is true when it isn’t.  
  *Example:* Flagging a legit email as spam.
  
- **Type II Error (False Negative):** Predicting something is false when it’s true.  
  *Example:* Missing a cancer diagnosis in a screening.

**Which one matters more** depends on the context. In fraud detection or security, Type II is usually worse. In spam filters, maybe Type I is more annoying.

---

**5. Explain cross-validation and why it’s important.**  
**Answer:**  
Cross-validation helps you assess your model’s **generalizability**.

**Most common:**
- **k-Fold Cross-Validation:** Split the data into k equal parts, train on k-1 and validate on the remaining. Repeat k times and average the results.
- **Stratified k-Fold:** Maintains class proportions in each fold. Ideal for classification.
- **LOOCV (Leave-One-Out):** For very small datasets.

It helps with:
- **Model selection**
- **Hyperparameter tuning**
- **Reducing overfitting risk**
- **Ensuring performance stability**

---

**6. What are precision, recall, and F1-score?**  
**Answer:**  
Metrics that go beyond just "accuracy", especially important in imbalanced datasets.

- **Precision = TP / (TP + FP)**  
  How many predicted positives were actually correct.
  
- **Recall = TP / (TP + FN)**  
  How many actual positives the model caught.
  
- **F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)**  
  A harmonic mean of precision and recall.

**When to use what?**  
- Use **precision** when false positives are expensive (e.g., spam filters).  
- Use **recall** when false negatives are worse (e.g., medical diagnoses).  
- Use **F1** when you need a balance of both.

---

**7. How would you optimize a model's inference speed on limited hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi or mobile)?**  
**Answer:**

**Optimization Techniques:**
- **Model Selection:** Use small, efficient models like MobileNet, Tiny YOLO, or Decision Trees.
- **Quantization:** Convert model weights from 32-bit floats to 8-bit integers.
- **Pruning:** Remove insignificant weights/connections.
- **Use Optimized Formats:** Export model to TFLite (TensorFlow Lite), ONNX, or TensorRT.
- **Reduce Input Size:** Downscale images or reduce time-series lengths.
- **Use Hardware Acceleration:** Leverage GPU/TPU/EdgeTPUs if available.
- **Batch Inference or Caching:** When possible, predict on multiple inputs together or reuse parts of computation.

**8. How would you deploy a machine learning model into production?**  
**Answer:**

**Typical ML Deployment Pipeline:**
1. **Train & Save Model** – using `joblib`, `pickle`, or framework-specific save methods.
2. **API Creation** – Serve the model through an API using **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
3. **Containerization** – Package with Docker for consistent deployment across environments.
4. **Monitoring** – Log predictions, latency, and flag anomalies using Prometheus, ELK, or custom logs.
5. **Versioning** – Use tools like MLFlow or DVC for tracking changes in data, models, and code.
6. **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automate testing and deployment with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.
7. **Scaling** – Use Kubernetes or AWS/GCP services for auto-scaling based on load.

**9. How would you monitor a deployed ML model?**  
**Answer:**

**Key Monitoring Aspects:**
- **Input Data Drift:** Monitor changes in input features over time. Tools: EvidentlyAI, Alibi Detect.
- **Prediction Drift:** Watch for changes in output distributions.
- **Latency & Throughput:** Track response time and requests per second.
- **Performance Tracking:** Use delayed true labels (if available) to compute accuracy/F1 periodically.

- **Alerts & Logging:** Trigger alerts if performance drops or data distribution shifts.
- **Retraining Loops:** Set up pipelines to periodically retrain the model with fresh data.

**10. How do you ensure reproducibility in ML experiments?**  
**Answer:**

**Best Practices for Reproducibility:**
- **Fix Random Seeds:** In NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc., set seeds.
- **Environment Control:** Use `requirements.txt`, `conda`, or Docker to fix dependencies.
- **Track Experiments:** Use MLFlow, Weights & Biases, or TensorBoard to log hyperparameters and metrics.
- **Version Control:** Use Git to version both code and experiment results.
- **Data Versioning:** Use DVC or hash-based checks to ensure you're training on the same dataset.
- **Pipelines:** Package your preprocessing, training, and evaluation into deterministic steps (e.g., Scikit-learn Pipelines or ZenML).
